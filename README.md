# Java 8 kata
## Expectations
This project is supposed to very quickly introduce you to the java 8 lambdas and streams world. All exercises can be
done in small groups, sharing the keyboard between the students in every 10m or after each test.

## Instructions
1. Start with `IntroduceLambdaItShouldTest` and try to implement lambdas instead of anonymous classes (you will not be
able to implement them in all of the cases).

2. Having the basic knowledge of lambdas, go ahead and fix tests located at `...streams` package. Please stick to the
suggested order.

3. If you're stuck - don't worry. You can peek the correct answer in the `pl.kurylek.katas.java8.streams.answers`. But
please don't abuse this possibility :)

4. Why the funky class naming?
- It's supposed to be mocking yoda.
